# modleR logo 

This is the repo for our package logo. We buit the logo using the `hexSticker` package (Guangchuang 2019).

The adequability map in the logo was buit using `modleR` and corresponds to the climatic adeaquability map of the Andean bear *Tremarctos ornatus*. We used occurrence data from [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org) and climatic variables for South America from [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org) in the form of a PCA to generate the map.

In the logo we used Miriam Libre font, developed by [Michael Sahar](github.com/MichalSahar/Miriam-Libre) and available at google fonts.
